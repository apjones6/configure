# Configure

A simple application designed to overwrite configuration values in targeted locations. This can be
useful when your team development practise leads to developers committing configuration values which
are specific to each individual.

## Publish

You can create a standalone EXE (windows x64) by following these steps:

 - Restore NuGet packages
 - Release build
 - Run publish/publish.bat

This will produce configure.exe in the publish folder.
